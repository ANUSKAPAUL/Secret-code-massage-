# Secret Code Message Encoder 🔐

This is a Python program that allows you to encode messages in two different ways:

---

## 🔢 Modes Available

### *1️⃣ Prefix–Suffix Transform*
- Each word is encoded by:
  - Generating two random 3-letter codes (r1 and r2)
  - Moving the first letter of the word to the end
  - Adding r1 at the start and r2 at the end  
- Example:
- ---

### *2️⃣ Rotate Middle Characters*
- Works only for words with length ≥ 7  
- Keeps the first 3 and last 3 characters fixed  
- Rotates the middle characters by one position  
- Short words (len ≤ 6) are simply reversed  
- Example:
- ---

## 📝 Usage

1. Run the program:
 ```bash
 python hello2.py
⭐Features
➡️Dynamic random codes for mode 1
➡️ Middle rotation algorithem for long words
➡️clean readable python logic
➡️Biginner friendly and fun to test
🛠️FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
. add decoding options
. add encryption levels
. build a GUI version
. convert to a web based encoder
